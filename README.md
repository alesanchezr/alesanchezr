Hello 👋! I'm rebuilding coding education 💻. I will help you build a successful tech career through @4Geeks and @4GeeksAcademy.

Follow my 🎙️Podcast: https://bit.ly/42yfoZp and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr).

I created [LearnPack](https://www.learnpack.co/) as a free tool to help teachers create interactive coding tutorials.  
I co-founded [4Geeks Academy](https://4geeksacademy.com/) to help people join the tech world ASAP.  
I co-founded [4Geeks.com](https://4geeks.com/) to help those who want to learn independently.  

I still code a lot every day, build syllabi, create content, etc.
🔥 Join the tech world now, or get left behind.
